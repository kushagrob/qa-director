# QA Director

**The fastest way to build a complete, reliable E2E test suite ‚Äî powered by Playwright MCP and Claude Code.**

QA Director is an AI-powered CLI tool that helps you go from **natural language ‚Üí fully integrated Playwright test** in seconds. No brittle codegen. No manual test writing. No wrestling with auth, roles, or CI setup.

Just describe the test. We‚Äôll handle the rest.\

## Why QA Director?

- üß† **Natural Language to Test Code**  
  Describe what you want to test in plain English. QA Director spins up a browser, runs the flow, and generates a clean, stable Playwright test ‚Äî using Claude Code for intelligent placement and structure. **Works seamlessly even if you already have a Playwright E2E test suite set up.**

- ‚öôÔ∏è **Zero-Config Setup**  
  Don‚Äôt know Playwright? You don‚Äôt have to. QA Director auto-detects your config, sets up test folders, handles environment variables, and wires up GitHub Actions ‚Äî all out-of-the-box.

- üîê **Auth + Roles Handled for You**  
  Managing multiple users or sessions? QA Director records your login flows using Playwright codegen and stores role-based auth state ‚Äî no extra code or boilerplate needed.

- üîí **Smart Environment Variable Detection**  
  Automatically scrubs and replaces sensitive values like tokens or emails with environment-safe variables.

- üöÄ **CI-Ready from Day 1**  
  Comes with GitHub Actions E2E workflows pre-configured. Just push and your tests run.

1. **Describe your test**  
   Run `qa-director generate` and write your scenario in plain English.

2. **Live browser execution**  
   A Chromium instance runs the flow using **Playwright MCP**, capturing DOM actions and screenshots.

3. **Claude Code powers generation**  
   **Claude Code SDK** converts the flow into a clean, reliable Playwright test, and figures out where in your codebase to put it.

4. **Zero setup**  
   Tests are placed in the right folder with auth, roles, and env vars handled automatically.

5. **CI-ready**  
   GitHub Actions is pre-configured‚Äîpush your code and the tests just run.

## Installation

```bash
npm install qa-director
```

## Quick Start

### 1. Initialize QA Director

```bash
npx qa-director init
```

This will:

- Detect your Playwright configuration
- Set up authentication directories
- Create environment files
- Configure GitHub Actions (optional)
- Generate initial setup files

### 2. Set up a login role

```bash
npx qa-director login user
```

This will:

- Launch Playwright codegen to record your login flow
- Detect and replace sensitive data with environment variables
- Update setup files and Playwright configuration
- Create role-specific test folders (optional)

### 3. Generate tests

```bash
npx qa-director generate --role user "Test user can create a new post"
```

This will:

- Run browser automation with your specified role
- Use AI to generate a complete Playwright test
- Add the test to your codebase in the appropriate location

## Commands

### `qa-director init`

Initialize qa-director in your current project.

### `qa-director login <role>`

Set up authentication for a specific role.

**Arguments:**

- `<role>` - Role name

**Examples:**

```bash
qa-director login admin
qa-director login user --refresh
qa-director login --role admin
qa-director login --role user --refresh
```

### `qa-director generate --role <role> "<description>"`

Generate an E2E test using AI.

**Arguments:**

- `<description>` - Natural language description of what to test

**Examples:**

```bash
qa-director generate --role user "Test user can update their profile"
qa-director generate --role admin "Test admin can delete a user account"
```

### `qa-director eject`

Remove qa-director files and configurations from your project.

**Examples:**

```bash
qa-director eject                    # Remove all qa-director files
qa-director eject --role user        # Remove only the 'user' role
qa-director eject --dry-run          # Preview what would be removed
qa-director eject --force            # Skip confirmation prompt
```

**Role-specific ejection includes:**

- Role files (storage state, test folders)
- Role entry from qa-director.config.ts
- Role configuration from Playwright config (with AI assistance)
- Role login flow from auth.setup.ts (with AI assistance)
- Role-specific environment variables
- Role secrets from GitHub Actions workflow

## Configuration

QA Director creates a `qa-director.config.ts` file in your project root:

```typescript
import { QADirectorConfig } from "qa-director";

const config: QADirectorConfig = {
  baseURL: "http://localhost:3000",
  testDir: "./tests",
  roles: [
    {
      name: "user",
      storagePath: "./playwright/.auth/storageState.user.json",
      testMatch: ["./tests/user/**/*.{test,spec}.{js,ts}"],
      envVars: ["QA_USER_EMAIL", "QA_USER_PASSWORD"],
    },
  ],
  authDir: "playwright/.auth",
  githubActions: {
    enabled: true,
    path: ".github/workflows/qa-director.yml",
  },
  setup: {
    path: "./tests/auth.setup.ts",
    enabled: true,
  },
  envDir: ".env.qa",
  playwrightConfig: "playwright.config.ts",
};

export default config;
```

## Environment Variables

Create a `.env.qa` file with your configuration:

```bash
# Required
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_anthropic_api_key_here

# Auto-generated based on detected login flows
QA_USER_EMAIL=user@example.com
QA_USER_PASSWORD=your_password_here
QA_ADMIN_EMAIL=admin@example.com
QA_ADMIN_PASSWORD=admin_password_here
```

## Project Structure

After initialization, your project will have:

```
your-project/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ qa-director.config.ts       # QA Director configuration
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .env.qa                     # Environment variables
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .env.qa.example            # Environment template
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ tests/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ auth.setup.ts          # Authentication setup
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ user/                  # User role tests (optional)
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ admin/                 # Admin role tests (optional)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ playwright/.auth/          # Authentication states
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ storageState.user.json
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ storageState.admin.json
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ .github/workflows/
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ qa-director.yml        # GitHub Actions workflow
```

## Role Management

QA Director supports multiple roles with separate authentication states:

- **Role Isolation**: Each role has its own storage state and test folder
- **Environment Variables**: Automatically detected and managed per role
- **Test Organization**: Optional role-specific folders for better organization
- **Playwright Integration**: Automatic project configuration for each role

## GitHub Actions

QA Director automatically sets up GitHub Actions for E2E testing:

```yaml
name: QA Director E2E Tests
on:
  push:
    branches: [main, develop]
  pull_request:
    branches: [main, develop]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v4
